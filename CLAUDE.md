# Project Instructions

This file is the operating guide for the agent working in this repository.

The repo is organized around three separate responsibilities:

- `workflows/` contains the step-by-step procedures
- `tools/` contains scripts that perform repeatable actions
- the agent reads the workflow, decides what to do next, and invokes the right tool

Use that split consistently. Reasoning and judgment stay with the agent. Repetitive execution should live in code whenever possible.

## Operating Approach

For any task in this project:

1. Find the workflow that matches the request
2. Read the workflow before taking action
3. Check `tools/` for an existing script that already handles the needed step
4. Prefer the scripted path over doing the task manually in chat
5. Ask follow-up questions only when the workflow or inputs leave a real ambiguity

If a required tool does not exist, add one only after confirming there is not already a close match in the repo.

## Resource Check

Before starting any task that will consume meaningful time, AI usage, API credits, or produce large batches of output, do a quick quality check first.

Stop and flag the issue if any of the following is true:

- the resume does not fit the role being targeted
- the job description does not match the stated search goals
- there is missing or conflicting data that would make the result weak or wasteful

If something looks wrong, raise it before committing resources. A short pause up front is better than spending time on output that will be discarded.

This also applies in the middle of a workflow. If the mismatch becomes obvious later, stop at that point and ask for confirmation before continuing.

## Existing Tools First

Before building new logic, inspect `tools/` and use what is already available.

Only create a new script when the repository does not already contain a tool for that job.

## Failure Handling

When a tool or command fails:

1. read the full error output
2. determine whether the problem is caused by inputs, environment, or code
3. fix the smallest issue that unblocks progress
4. rerun carefully

If the rerun would spend money, credits, or send an external message, get confirmation first.

## Workflow Maintenance

Workflows should improve as real-world issues appear. If you discover a better method, a recurring failure mode, or a missing instruction, capture that improvement in the workflow when the user asks you to update it.

Do not overwrite or replace workflows casually. They are part of the operating system for this project and should be changed deliberately.

## Continuous Improvement

Use failures to strengthen the system:

1. identify what broke
2. correct the tool or process
3. verify the fix
4. record the lesson in the relevant workflow when requested
5. continue with the improved version

## Repository Layout

Use the repository with these assumptions:

- `.tmp/` is for temporary and regenerable files
- `tools/` holds deterministic scripts and integrations
- `workflows/` holds written procedures
- `.env` stores project state and search criteria, but not auth secrets
- `~/.config/gws/` stores machine-local Google OAuth files outside the repo

Outputs the user needs should end up in the destination service they actually use, such as Google Drive, Google Sheets, or email. Local files are mainly for staging and intermediate processing.

## Python on Windows

Do not assume Python is absent just because one command fails.

Check in this order:

1. `py --version`
2. `python --version`
3. `python3 --version`

A command only counts as working if it reports `Python 3.x`. Messages about the Microsoft Store, missing commands, or blank output only mean that particular command failed.

Once you find a working Python command, use that same command for the rest of the session.

## Shell Input Safety

Do not pass large blocks of text directly on the command line.

If a tool needs a resume, job description, notes, or similar content:

1. write the content to a file in `.tmp/`
2. pass the file path to the tool

This avoids shell escaping issues and prevents characters from being mangled.

## Permission Prompts

`.claude/settings.local.json` is included on purpose to reduce approval friction during scheduled or autonomous runs.

During onboarding or other interactive setup, explain permission prompts in plain English before triggering them. Keep it simple:

1. say what you are about to do
2. explain that a permission prompt will appear
3. say whether it is expected and safe to approve
4. then run the command

During automated runs or direct execution requests, proceed without narrating every step unless something is clearly wrong.

If the inputs appear obviously bad, corrupted, or unrelated to the intended workflow, stop and flag that before continuing.

## Entry Point

`run.md` is the main entry point for this project.

If the user says something that clearly means "begin", such as:

- `start`
- `go`
- `run`
- `run the workflow`
- `start the workflow`
- `let's go`
- `kick it off`
- `do your thing`

then read `run.md` and execute from there without asking which workflow they mean.
