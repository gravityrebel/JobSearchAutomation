# Workflow: Tailor Resume

## Objective
Rewrite the user's resume to mirror the language, keywords, and priorities of a specific job description. The output is a new .docx built from the original resume as a template — preserving all fonts, sizes, spacing, bold, colors, and layout exactly. The URL is written back into the job tracker sheet.

## When This Runs
- Called automatically by `workflows/search_jobs.md` for each new job added to the sheet.
- Never runs standalone unless manually triggered for a specific job.

## Inputs (passed in from search_jobs)
- `job_url` — direct link to the job posting
- `job_description` — full text of the job description
- `company` — company name
- `job_title` — job title
- `sheet_row` — row number in the Google Sheet to write the result back to

---

## Step 0: Resume–Role Fit Check

Before doing any work, compare the resume (from `RESUME_DRIVE_URL` in `.env`) against the `job_title` and `job_description` inputs.

Look for obvious mismatch signals — the same signals used during onboarding:
- The recent experience is in a different function or career track than the target role
- The resume lacks most of the core skills, tools, or domain language implied by the role
- The resume would require heavy reframing rather than normal tailoring

**If the mismatch is obvious:**

Stop. Do not proceed. Tell the user:

> "The resume on file looks significantly misaligned with the role being applied to ([job_title] at [company]). Tailoring it is likely to produce a weak result and would waste compute. Would you like to replace the resume first, or proceed anyway?"

Wait for a response before continuing.

- **User says replace:** Ask them to drop the new resume into the `resume/` folder and type 'done'. Then re-run onboarding Step 4 (Resume Review and Upload), and resume tailoring with the new file.
- **User says proceed anyway:** Continue to Step 1.

**If the fit is reasonable or ambiguous:** Continue to Step 1 silently.

This check applies even when called from `search_jobs.md` mid-run. If you notice the resume is mismatched for the first job, pause the entire batch and ask — do not tailor any jobs until the user responds.

## Step 1: Load Resume Structure

Run:
```
python tools/tailor_resume.py --action read_resume_structured
```

This reads the original .docx and returns every paragraph numbered and tagged:
```
1|[HEADER] Jordan Lee
2|[NORMAL] City, State | 000-000-0000 | candidate@example.com
3|[EMPTY]
4|[HEADER] PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
5|[NORMAL] Experienced lease accounting manager with 8 years...
6|[HEADER] EXPERIENCE
7|[ROLE] Accounting Manager | Acme Corp | 2019–Present
8|[BULLET] Managed portfolio of 30 leases totaling $100K monthly rents
9|[BULLET] Reduced close cycle from 10 days to 6 through process automation
10|[EMPTY]
11|[ROLE] Staff Accountant | Prior Corp | 2016–2019
12|[BULLET] Prepared monthly financial statements
```

Tag meanings:
- `[HEADER]` — section heading (e.g. "EXPERIENCE", "EDUCATION") or name line — rewrite lightly or leave as-is
- `[ROLE]` — job title / company / date line — this is a **section boundary anchor**; never move or reorder these lines
- `[NORMAL]` — body paragraph that is NOT a role anchor — rewrite to match job language
- `[BULLET]` — list item — rewrite, lead with a strong action verb
- `[EMPTY]` — blank spacer line — return exactly as `N|[EMPTY]`, never change

**If the tool does not distinguish [ROLE] from [NORMAL]:** Identify [ROLE] lines yourself.
A line is a `[ROLE]` if it immediately follows a `[HEADER]` or `[EMPTY]` line and contains a job title,
company name, and/or date range. Treat it as `[ROLE]` in your working copy regardless of what the tool tagged it.

**If the tool returns a .doc error:** Run `python tools/tailor_resume.py --action convert_to_docx` first, then retry.

If it fails for any other reason, log the error and skip this job.

---

## Step 2: Analyze the Job Description

Using the `job_description` text, identify:

1. **Required skills** — technologies, tools, certifications mentioned as required or preferred
2. **Key responsibilities** — the top 5–7 action-verb phrases describing what the role does
3. **Tone and language style** — formal vs. casual, technical depth, industry jargon
4. **Priority signals** — words that appear repeatedly or appear in the first paragraph

This analysis is done directly by the agent — no tool call needed.

---

## Step 3: Rewrite the Resume

Before writing a single line, build a **section map** from the numbered paragraph list:

```
Section map (example):
  Lines 1–5:   Header / contact / summary (no [ROLE] anchor — global scope)
  Lines 6–6:   [HEADER] EXPERIENCE
  Lines 7–15:  ROLE → "Accounting Manager | Acme Corp | 2019–Present"
  Lines 16–25: ROLE → "Staff Accountant | Prior Corp | 2016–2019"
  Lines 26–26: [HEADER] EDUCATION
  Lines 27–29: Education content
```

Write out this map before rewriting. It is your structural contract — every bullet you move,
rewrite, or reorder must stay within its assigned section's line range.

Now produce a rewritten version in the **exact same format** — same paragraph numbers, same tags, same total count.

**Rules:**

**DO:**
- **Fully rewrite every sentence and bullet** to lead with the job's exact language, priorities, and keywords — not just swap a few words. Every [NORMAL] and [BULLET] line should read as if it was written specifically for this role
- Open the summary with the job title or closest equivalent from the posting, then immediately establish the most relevant skills and experience in the job's own vocabulary
- Mirror the job description's exact phrases, action verbs, and technical terms throughout — if the JD says "high-performance frontend platforms," use that phrase, not a paraphrase
- Reorder bullet points to lead with the most relevant experience, **but only within the same role's section**
- Use the same verb tense and style as the job description
- Preserve all numbers, dollar amounts, dates, and company names exactly as they appear in the original
- Return every [EMPTY] line unchanged: `N|[EMPTY]`
- Return every [ROLE] line with its paragraph number and tag preserved exactly — only light rewording of the title itself is allowed

**DO NOT:**
- Move any content across a [ROLE] boundary — a bullet that belongs to Role A must stay between Role A's anchor line and Role B's anchor line
- Reorder [ROLE] lines — role order must match the original exactly
- Invent facts — every claim must be traceable to a fact in the original resume. Rewrite sentences completely, but don't fabricate skills, tools, companies, dates, or job titles that aren't there
- Add bullet points that don't exist in the source resume
- Produce minimal word-swaps — if the rewritten line still sounds mostly like the original, rewrite it again more aggressively
- Use filler phrases like "results-driven" unless they were in the original
- Change paragraph count — the output must have the same number of lines as the input

**Example output:**
```
1|[HEADER] Jordan Lee
2|[NORMAL] City, State | 000-000-0000 | candidate@example.com
3|[EMPTY]
4|[HEADER] PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
5|[NORMAL] Lease accounting specialist with 8 years driving compliance and efficiency...
6|[HEADER] EXPERIENCE
7|[ROLE] Accounting Manager | Acme Corp | 2019–Present
8|[BULLET] Oversaw portfolio of 30 commercial leases generating $100K in monthly rents
9|[BULLET] Accelerated close cycle from 10 to 6 days through targeted process automation
10|[EMPTY]
11|[ROLE] Staff Accountant | Prior Corp | 2016–2019
12|[BULLET] Prepared monthly financial statements
```

---

## Step 3.5: Verify Section Integrity Before Saving

Before writing anything to disk, run this checklist against your rewritten paragraph list.
If any check fails, fix the output and re-run the checklist — do not proceed until all pass.

**Check 1 — Paragraph count matches**
Count the lines in your rewrite. It must equal the count from Step 1.
If it doesn't: find the missing or extra line and correct it.

**Check 2 — [ROLE] anchors are in the same positions**
For each [ROLE] line in the original, confirm it appears at the same paragraph number in your rewrite.
If a [ROLE] line has shifted: something was inserted or deleted above it. Find and fix it.

**Check 3 — No content has crossed a role boundary**
For each role section (the lines between one [ROLE] anchor and the next), confirm that all bullet
content in your rewrite was present in the same section in the original.
Concretely: pick 2–3 bullets from each role in your rewrite and verify they appear
in the corresponding role in the original.
If a bullet appears under the wrong role: move it back to its correct section.

**Check 4 — [EMPTY] lines are unchanged**
Every line tagged [EMPTY] in the original must appear at the same number and be unchanged.

**If all 4 checks pass:** log "Section integrity verified." and continue to Step 4.
**If any check fails:** fix the output, log what was wrong and what you corrected, and re-run all 4 checks.

---

## Step 4: Save Rewritten Content to File

**Do NOT pass resume content as a command-line argument.** The shell corrupts special characters — `$100K` becomes `00K`, `50%` disappears. Always write to a file first.

Use the Write tool to save the rewritten paragraph list to:
```
.tmp/resume_<Company>_<JobTitle>.txt
```

---

## Step 5: Build and Upload Tailored Resume

Run:
```
python tools/tailor_resume.py --action create_doc_from_template \
  --company "<company>" \
  --job_title "<job_title>" \
  --content_file ".tmp/resume_<Company>_<JobTitle>.txt"
```

The tool:
1. Copies the original .docx as a template
2. Walks every paragraph and replaces text with the rewritten version
3. Preserves all original formatting — fonts, sizes, bold, italic, colors, spacing, indentation
4. Saves the result to `.tmp/` and uploads to the "Tailored Resumes" folder in Google Drive
5. Returns the shareable Drive URL

---

## Step 6: Write URL Back to Sheet

Run `python tools/sheets.py --action update_notes` with:
- `--sheet_id` = `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` (from `.env`)
- `--row_num` = the `sheet_row` input
- `--notes` = the Drive URL from Step 5

---

## Step 7: Send Email Notification

Read `USER_EMAIL` and `GOOGLE_SHEET_ID` from `.env`.

Run:
```
python tools/notify.py \
  --to "<USER_EMAIL>" \
  --job_title "<job_title>" \
  --company "<company>" \
  --resume_url "<drive_url_from_step_5>" \
  --job_url "<job_url>" \
  --sheet_url "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<GOOGLE_SHEET_ID>"
```

- If it succeeds: continue silently.
- If it fails: log the error to `.tmp/tailor_resume_log.txt` but do NOT block — the resume
  was already saved and the sheet was already updated. Notification failure is non-fatal.

---

## Step 8: Return Result

Return the Drive URL to the calling workflow (`search_jobs.md`).

---

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|---|---|
| .doc file detected | Run `convert_to_docx` action first, then retry |
| Resume not found | Log error, skip this job |
| Job description blank | Log warning, attempt rewrite with job title only |
| Paragraph count mismatch after rewrite | Fix rewrite before proceeding — never save a misaligned result |
| [ROLE] anchor shifted in rewrite | Fix rewrite — move displaced content back to its correct section |
| Content crossed role boundary | Fix rewrite — return content to the role it originated from |
| Upload fails | Log error, return None — Notes column stays blank |
| Sheet update fails | Log error, still return the Drive URL |
| Notification fails | Log error, continue — resume and sheet are already saved |

All errors logged to `.tmp/tailor_resume_log.txt` with timestamp and job URL.

---

## Quality Constraints

- Every number, dollar amount, date, and company name in the tailored resume must match the source exactly
- Do not pad the resume — if the original is one page, the output should be one page
- The rewrite is traceable: every line in the output must be derivable from a line in the original

---

## Tools Used
- `tools/tailor_resume.py` — reads resume structure, applies rewrite to template, uploads to Drive
- `tools/sheets.py` — writes Drive URL back to Notes column
- `tools/notify.py` — sends email notification with resume and job links
- `tools/google_auth.py` — provides authenticated credentials
